                              Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. <br>
                              Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. <br>
                              Let's build some happy little clouds up here. Get tough with it, get strong. That easy.<br>
                              We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there.<br>
                               If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. <br>
                               You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. 
                               <br>If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see.<br>And maybe, maybe, maybe... Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. A big strong tree needs big strong roots. Be brave. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one.<br>A happy cloud. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first.<br>In life you need colors. Let that brush dance around there and play. That's crazy.<br>Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. We'll do another happy little painting. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them.<br>You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here.<br>
